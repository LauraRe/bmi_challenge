# BMI challenge

Goal: write a JavaScript program that calculates an individual`s BMI index with metric and imperial methods.


## What is BMI:

Body mass index (BMI) is a simple tool that is generally used to estimate the total amount of body fat. 


## How To Calculate BMI value:

- METRIC METHOD
    
    The metric formula accepts height measurements in meters and weight in kilograms. If you know your height in centimeters only, simply divide the number of centimeters by 100 convert it to meters.

    1.Multiply your height by itself.
    2.Divide your weight in kilograms by the value calculated in step 1.
    3.The resulting number is your BMI. Compare this BMI value with the weight status table below.

- IMPERIAL METHOD
    
    The imperial formula accepts height measurements in inches and weight in pounds.


    1.Multiply your weight in pounds by 703.
    2.Multiply your height in inches by itself
    3.Divide the figure from step 1 by the figure in step 2. The resulting number is your BMI. 

Compare the BMI value with the weight statuses below to get the corresponding category:

BMI WEIGHT STATUS CATEGORIES

Below 18.5 : Underweight   
18.5 - 24.9 : Healthy  
25 - 29.9 : Overweight
